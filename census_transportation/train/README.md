#### techniques to keep in mind
- dropout (to prevent dependence in the network on a single node)
- fully connected network (the type of nn that I want to use)
- minibatching (definitely do this) (train the model with a certain number of data at a time)
- SGD vs ADAM (try SGD, which is supposedly better if you can give it the right hyperparameters)
